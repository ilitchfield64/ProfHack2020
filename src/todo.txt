Things To Do
- Music not working in jar
- Fix the player hit box 
    // It is too far right
- Add Difficulties
- Reorganize the code more
    // It's a mess
    // Make it more object oriented and less procedural
        - Start implementing true enemy objects
- Have one uniform screen instead of JOptionPanes controlling title and game over
- Measure the distance from end to end and use it to implement either levels or increasing difficulty
