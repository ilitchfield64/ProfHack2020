Things To Do
- Have the enemy bullets keep going when they are killed?
    // May need to introduce enemies as separate objects? 
- Add Difficulties
 Rework and simplify code
    // Make it more object oriented and less procedural
        - Start implementing true enemy objects
- Have one uniform screen instead of JOptionPanes controlling title and game over
- Measure the distance traveled and use it to implement either levels or increasing difficulty
- Add some sort of bosses
    // Maybe switch perspective to rear view third person and have bosses like Andross in Star Fox 64
