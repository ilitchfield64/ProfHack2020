***ProfHacks 2020 Group Project***

In this project our team designed a game engine in Java using swing. There were many challenges that we faced such as struggling with maintaining a proper git repository. We learned to work together with properly commenting and organizing our code. Our team worked previously on a side scroller for the NJIT 2019 Hackathon on behalf of our college's Computer Science Club. After learning from our mistakes and thanks to this prior experience we are well prepared, and very hopeful for our project this time around!
